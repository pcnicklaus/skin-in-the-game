# README

Lots of work still to be done on this one which is daunting but pretty exciting cuz this is a pretty cool idea. Semi functional working version can be found here: https://skin-in-the-game.herokuapp.com/

Premise: Doing stuff, especially learny type stuff, can be hard. So what if you make it a challenge / game / bet type thing. For example:
Me: want's to learn some spanish. You do too. So we make a challenge, define how we'll know if we complete it, throw in some loot and decide what happens with it if we both succeed or one wins. Regardless of the outcome, the plan is take 10% of the money, 4% to cc fees or so and then the rest charity/expenses. Want one of the ever present options of failing in the a challenge is to have the money go to the charity of the users choice.
